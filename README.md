# Reinforcement Learning â€“ 10-Armed Bandits

This repository contains a project on **k-armed bandits** (k = 10), completed as part of the Reinforcement Learning course at Leiden University (2024).  
We investigate and compare different action-selection policies in a simplified non-sequential MDP setting.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
- **Environment**: 10-armed bandit with Bernoulli-distributed rewards; each armâ€™s mean reward is sampled from a uniform distribution on [0,1].  
- **Policies studied**:
  - **Îµ-greedy**: Selects the current best-known arm most of the time, explores randomly with probability Îµ.  
  - **Optimal Initialization (OI)**: Uses optimistic initial estimates to encourage exploration.  
  - **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**: Balances exploration and exploitation using confidence intervals.  
- **Experiments**:
  - Testing different hyperparameters for each policy: Îµ, initial values, and UCB exploration constant *c*.  
  - Evaluating both **learning curves** (immediate reward) and **performance curves** (average reward over time).  
  - Comparing optimized policies based on average total reward and exploration behavior.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Findings
- Extreme hyperparameter values perform poorly, either slowing learning or reducing final rewards.  
- Best parameters found:  
  - Îµ-greedy: Îµ = 0.05 or 0.1  
  - Optimal Initialization: init value = 0.5  
  - UCB: c = 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, or 0.25  
- **Upper Confidence Bound policy** performs best overall, providing fast exploration and optimal exploitation.  
- Îµ-greedy performs worst in all considered characteristics; Optimal Initialization is slower initially but improves with tuned parameters.
